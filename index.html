        <p>
          Hey, I’m Eric, a designer who’s just as passionate about creating meaningful visual experiences as I am about staying active and leveling up in real life.
          My journey into design started with curiosity and has grown into a deep appreciation for how visuals, interaction, and storytelling shape the way we experience the world.
          Outside of design, you’ll probably find me at the gym, playing soccer, or diving into worlds like Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, GTA V, or The Last of Us. I love how games blend art, sound, and interaction, the same creative principles that inspire my own approach to design.
          For me, design is about constant growth, pushing boundaries, learning from every challenge, and building experiences that connect with people.

          ABOUT PROJECT
        </h2>
        <p>
         The Transit App helps parents and students find accurate bus routes and stop information. It also introduces a community-based carpooling feature, giving families more flexible commuting options.
        </p>
          <h2>
            TRANSIT APP THOUGHT PROCESS 
        </h2>
<p>
Understanding the user was a crucial part throughout the design process. As someone who uses public transport, I already had some personal insight on the matter. Having a transit app that allows for carpooling and school buses was an interesting challenge, but first I had to find out if this was actually a problem people cared about. After carrying out extensive research with the aid of surveys and online public forums, I was certain that this was a challenge that required a modern solution.
        </p>
        <h2>
          CARPOOL SECTION
        </h2>

<p>
First being the carpool section. I took inspiration from various car-riding apps like Uber and Lyft. As this was a time I was beginning to refine my design skills, an important lesson I learned was you don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Building on this I was able to begin creating the layout for the app.

Building off the original transit app, I was able to integrate both the carpool and the school bus features.

        <h2>
          THE GOAL
        </h2>
<p>
Design a responsive, user-friendly app that:
<ul>
  <li>Provides accurate and real-time bus route and stop information.</li>

<li>Enables safe and reliable community carpooling options.</li>

<li>Reduces stress for parents and students by simplifying commuting logistics.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2>
          USER RESEARCH
        </h2>
<p>
I conducted surveys and interviews with parents, students, and school transportation coordinators to understand their challenges.

Initial assumption: Users mainly wanted to find bus stops and track arrival times.
Key insight: Many parents were equally (or more) interested in safe carpooling options due to unreliable bus schedules and distant stops.

This shifted the design focus toward integrating a community carpooling feature alongside the bus route system.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Key Pain Points 
        </h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>No Real-Time Updates – Parents waiting in poor weather without knowing bus arrival times.</li>
    <li>Inconvenient Stops – Bus stops placed too far from homes or in unsafe areas.</li>
    <li>Carpooling Barriers – Families struggled to find trusted, safe carpooling options.</li>
    <li>Outdated Routes – Confusion and missed pickups due to unmaintained schedule data.</li>
      </ul>
